*Make sure you have downloaded the selenium as well as other required packages before you start working on this, you can find the required packages in the "requirements.txt" file.


*Make sure that you have enabled two step verfication for the gmail account that you intend to mail from, after that you create a app password which helps you not to put in your actual password of your gmail account. In order to create a app password, follow the below steps:
Click on profile --> Manage your google account --> Security(Found at left side corner) --> In security, go to Signing in to Google section, under this you will find App passwords(this is visible only if you enabled two step verification) --> A pop-up comes asking for gmail account password --> Under "Select the app and device you want to generate the app password for" section select the app as "Other(custom name)" and then enter the name of your choice and then click on generate.
